=head1 NAME

DBIx::Squirrel::dr - DBI database driver (DBI::dr) subclass

=head1 VERSION

2020.11.00

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $dbh = DBI->connect($data_source, $username, $password)
      or die $DBI::Squirrel::errstr;
    $dbh = DBI->connect($data_source, $username, $password, \%attr)
      or die $DBI::Squirrel::errstr;

    $dbh = DBI->connect_cached($data_source, $username, $password)
      or die $DBI::Squirrel::errstr;
    $dbh = DBI->connect_cached($data_source, $username, $password, \%attr)
      or die $DBI::Squirrel::errstr;

    $dbh = DBIx::Squirrel->connect($original_dbh, \%attr);
    $dbh = DBIx::Squirrel->connect_clone($original_dbh, \%attr);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module subclasses DBI's DBI::dr module to provide a new way to connect to
databases using database session handles.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 connect_clone

    $clone_dbh = DBI::Squirrel->connect_clone($original_dbh);
    $clone_dbh = DBI::Squirrel->connect_clone($original_dbh, \%attr);

Clones another database session, returning a DBIx-Squirrel database handle.

The attributes for the cloned session are the same as those used for the
original session, with any attributes in C<\%attr> merged over them.

Cloning a standard DBI::db session in this manner allows the clone to benefit
from DBIx-Squirrel's features.

DBIx-Squirrel's C<connect> method also allows a style of invocation that
results in a call to the C<connect_clone> method.

=head2 connect_cached

    $dbh = DBI->connect_cached($data_source, $username, $password)
      or die $DBI::Squirrel::errstr;
    $dbh = DBI->connect_cached($data_source, $username, $password, \%attr)
      or die $DBI::Squirrel::errstr;

Like C<connect>, except that the database handle returned is also stored in a
hash associated with the given parameters. If another call is made to the same
data source with the same parameter values, then the corresponding cached
database handle will be returned if it is still valid. The cached database
handle is replaced with a new connection if it has been disconnected, or if
the ping method fails.

For more detailed information about this method, please refer to the L<DBI>
documentation.


=cut

=head2 connect

    $dbh = DBI->connect($data_source, $username, $password)
      or die $DBI::Squirrel::errstr;
    $dbh = DBI->connect($data_source, $username, $password, \%attr)
      or die $DBI::Squirrel::errstr;

Establishes a database connection, or session, to the requested C<$data_source>,
returning a DBIx-Squirrel database handle if the connection succeeds.

For more detailed information about this style of method invocation, please
refer to the L<DBI> documentation.

DBIx-Squirrel provides for an alternative calling style:

    $clone_dbh = DBI::Squirrel->connect($original_dbh);
    $clone_dbh = DBI::Squirrel->connect($original_dbh, \%attr);

Calling C<connect> in this manner clones the original database handle as a
DBIx-Squirrel database handle.

The attributes for the cloned session are the same as those used for the
original session, with any attributes in C<\%attr> merged over them.
